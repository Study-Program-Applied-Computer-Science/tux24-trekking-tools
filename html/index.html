                        <p>When preparing for a hike, it's crucial to wear proper footwear;
                           invest in a good pair of hiking boots or shoes that provide support
                            and have good traction to ensure comfort and safety on varied terrain.
                             Dressing in layers is equally important; wear moisture-wicking clothing 
                             and layer up so you can adjust to changing temperatures and weather 
                             conditions. Additionally, always carry a backpack with essential items
                              such as a map, compass or GPS, water, snacks, a first-aid kit, a multi-tool, 
                              a flashlight, and extra clothing to be well-prepared for any situation that may arise 
                              during your hike</p>

                      <p>Hiking can be exhausting. 
                        That's why it's important to always have good hiking snacks in your backpack.
                         It doesn't matter whether you're going on a short hike or a multi-day hiking tour. 
                         Ideally, healthy hiking snacks should contain carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats, fiber, vitamins and minerals.
